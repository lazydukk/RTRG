This is a program that can be used by Scrabble Players or Coaches as a coaching tool to develop practice when it comes to Rack Balancing concepts. 

It's still work in progress. I am hoping to implement features similar to Zyzzyva and Quackle which displays the equity and valuation of the particular move that a player decides to go ahead with.

For now, you can randomly generate any 7 tiles according to the tile distribution and verbally test out the best options based on valuation.
